# Deep Learning in Python

This is the repo in which I will be storing my code for Deep Learning in Python. 

It's a simple course but it's something I need to do anyways.

## How to use this repo

This is also an exercise in using uv the python package manager that feels weirdly so similar to npm. god it feels like someone who does frontend switched quickly to python and then felt like they wanted to use flask but they were annoyed at python venv. I still love pip and venv but I feel like I should change to use some package manager that will be easier for others to use and download my shit.

It has a package lock file under uv.lock and a toml with metadata.

You can run this only by creating a project in python 3.11 since tensorflow doesn't support 3.12 yet. So I guess uv works well for that...
